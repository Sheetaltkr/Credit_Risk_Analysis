# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

### Purpose

- Perform Credit Risk Analysis by building and evaluating several machine learning models or algorithms for Fast lending, a peer to peer lending services company. The dataset to     be used is credit card credit dataset from LendingClub.
  The Tasks to be accomplished are:
    - Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
    - Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.

- Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk
- Evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

### Summary: 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
