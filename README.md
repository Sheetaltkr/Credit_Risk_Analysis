# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

### Purpose

- Perform Credit Risk Analysis by building and evaluating several machine learning models or algorithms for Fast lending, a peer to peer lending services company. The dataset to     be used is credit card credit dataset from LendingClub.
  The Tasks to be accomplished are:
    - Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
    - Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.

- Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk
- Evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

### Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

### Summary: 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
